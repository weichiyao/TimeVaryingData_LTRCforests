Description: Implements the conditional inference forest and random survival forest 
             algorithm to modeling left-truncated right-censored data with time-invariant        
             covariates, and (left-truncated) right-censored survival data with time-varying 
             covariates. It also provides functions to tune the parameters and evaluate the 
             model fit. See Yao et al. (2020) <arXiv:2006.00567>.
